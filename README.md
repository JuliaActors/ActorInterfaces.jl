A formalization of the actor model family in Julia.

The goal of this project is to provide a standard and usable API for actor programming. Applications written using this API will be independent from any specific actor library, and will run under all implementations of `ActorInterfaces.jl`.


Known implementations:

- QuickActors.jl, the reference implementation.
